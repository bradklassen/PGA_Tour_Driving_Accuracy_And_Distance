# The Evolution of Driving Accuracy and Driving Distance on the PGA Tour
This case study investigates the evolution of driving accuracy and driving distance over time by analyzing PGA Tour performance during the 2010 to 2018 seasons. The driving accuracy statistic follows a normal distribution, therefore parametric methods were used. Whereas, the driving distance statistic does not follow a normal distribution, so nonparametric methods were used. However, both parametric and nonparametric methods for each variable were conducted for comparison purposes. Although, parametric results for distance and nonparametric results for accuracy were not as reliable since normality conditions of these two variables violate the assumptions of their corresponding aforementioned methods. After comparing the mean values of accuracy and distance from all nine years, it was found that driving distance increased over time, whereas driving accuracy decreased over time. The negative correlation between these variables further shows that most players tend to improve on one variable at a time; the performance of the other is usually sacrificed.
